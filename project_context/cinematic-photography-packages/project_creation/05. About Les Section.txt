Let’s build the About Les Section — this is where your personality shines, and visitors connect with you, not just your photos. The goal is cinematic storytelling that makes people trust you and feel inspired to book.

👤 About Les Section — “Meet the Storyteller”
🎥 Transition from Packages

- As the user scrolls down, the package cards fade out.

- A subtle parallax swipe moves a full-screen cinematic portrait of you from left to center.

- The background gradient shifts from dark charcoal to a soft warm gold highlight behind the text area.

- Optional: A slow lens flare or moving light streak to give that “movie set” feel.

🧭 Layout Concept

Split-screen design:

- Left side: Large cinematic portrait of you (Les), slightly desaturated with a subtle golden highlight.

- Right side: Your story and personality in text.

Optional scroll animations:

- As user scrolls, portrait slightly zooms in.

- Text lines fade in individually with a typewriter or cinematic fade effect.

About Les

======================
Body Text

I’m Lesego — but you can call me Les. 
I’m a visual storyteller who turns moments into cinematic experiences. 
Every photoshoot I do is more than pictures — it’s about emotion, atmosphere, and authenticity. 

Whether it’s a close-up full of raw feeling or a motion shot with golden-hour light, I focus on creating images that make you feel like the main character of your story. 

Let’s make your moments unforgettable.
