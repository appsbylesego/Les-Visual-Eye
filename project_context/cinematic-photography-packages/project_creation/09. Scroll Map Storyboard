Let’s create a scroll map storyboard — a visual flow showing your website from top to bottom, including sections, animations, and transitions. Think of it like a cinematic storyboard for your site — this will make it crystal clear for Claude how everything should move and feel.

7️⃣ Visual Flow Diagram (Conceptual)

This storyboard + wireframe + full Claude context will make your website almost turnkey — cinematic, interactive, and story-driven from top to bottom.
