Now we’re moving into your Packages Section — the part that turns your visitors from “wow, this looks amazing” into “I want to book this guy right now.”
This section should feel like a movie trailer lineup — each package card sliding into view with cinematic transitions, depth, and motion.

💼 Packages Section — “The Experience”
🎥 Transition from Portfolio

As the user scrolls down from the portfolio:

The photos fade out into black, then three golden lines glide in (like a film reel transition).

A soft background track or heartbeat bass note could start here — subtle but emotional.

Then the header text fades in with a slow camera pan effect.

The Cinematic Experience

[fade-in subtext below]
Choose your story. Every package is crafted to capture your personality with cinematic precision.
======================

🎞️ Layout Style: Cinematic Cards

Use three interactive cards — each one should slightly tilt or rise as the user hovers, casting a soft cinematic shadow.
The background should remain dark (charcoal or black), and the cards should glow subtly in gold or amber around the edges.

Each card appears one by one as you scroll — sliding up with motion blur.
