Got it, Les — that’s smart, especially if you want to keep things professional and safe while still making it easy for clients to reach you. We can design your contact/booking system around email communication only. Here’s how we can structure it:

Safe, Email-Only Contact Approach
1️⃣ Contact Form

Include only these fields:

Name

Email ✅ (required)

Message / Shoot Details

Package Selection Dropdown (optional)

No phone number field needed.

Make the submit button clear: “Send Message / Book Your Session”.

2️⃣ Email Forwarding / CRM

The form submissions can go to a dedicated business email:

Example: hello@lesvisualeye.com

You could also integrate with Gmail or a free service like Formspree or Google Forms backend if you want automatic email notifications.

Optional: Auto-responder thanking them for contacting you and letting them know you’ll reply within 24–48 hours.

3️⃣ Privacy & Safety Features

Avoid displaying your personal phone number anywhere.

You can include a small line:

“For your safety, all communication is via email. We’ll respond promptly to confirm your session.”

Optional: Use reCAPTCHA on the form to prevent spam.

4️⃣ CTA Text Examples

Header: “Let’s Make Your Story Cinematic”

Subtext: “Email me your vision, select your package, and we’ll craft a cinematic experience together.”

Button: “Send Message / Book Your Session”

5️⃣ Optional Add-On

If you want to allow secure file upload (like reference photos or moodboards), you can add a small file input field in the form — still only via email.

This way, your site stays professional, fully functional for bookings, and your personal number stays private — all communication happens safely over email.
