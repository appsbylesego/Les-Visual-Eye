Here’s your Hero Section Script + Animation Breakdown — this will set the tone for your entire site. Think of it as your website’s opening movie trailer. It should grab attention, give emotion, and make people want to scroll.

🎬 Hero Section — “Opening Scene”
🎥 Visual Concept

- Background: Slow-motion video or cinematic reel of your work — maybe your subject turning toward the camera, camera lens glinting, soft depth-of-field.

- Lighting: Low light with warm orange flares or golden-hour glow.

- Overlay: Slight grain or lens flare effect — gives that “movie frame” energy.

- Music (optional): Deep, slow cinematic instrumental — ambient pads or subtle bass line.

🧭 Layout

Center of screen (fade-in animation, timed like a movie intro):

======================
[small text fades in first]
A Story Told in Every Frame

[then large cinematic text slides up slowly]
LES EGO PHOTOGRAPHY

[fade-in line under logo]
Cinematic Portraits. Real Emotion. Main Character Energy.

[buttons appear with smooth camera-pan motion]
[ Book a Shoot ]   [ View Portfolio ]

======================
Scroll cue:
A small animated downward arrow or film strip that moves slowly, inviting the user to scroll —
→ as they scroll, the hero video fades and the “About Les” or “Portfolio” section rises up with parallax movement.


⚙️ Animation Timeline (Claude Context)

1. 0–1s: Page fades from black, faint film grain appears.

2. 1–2s: “A Story Told in Every Frame” fades in, slight glow.

3. 2–4s: “LESEGO PHOTOGRAPHY” text slides up, golden cinematic highlight underlines it.

4. 4–5s: Tagline appears with soft typewriter effect.

5. 5–6s: Buttons fade in with motion blur + hover effects (light pulse).

6. 6–7s: Scroll arrow bounces slowly, looped animation.

7. Scroll: Background transitions into next section with a cinematic zoom-out effect.

💬 Copywriting Tone Suggestions

You can rotate or A/B test these for your tagline (Claude can animate them as changing captions):

- “Every shot, a story.”

- “You. The lens. The moment.”

- “Main character energy only.”

- “Cinematic portraits that feel alive.”


🧠 Claude Prompt Summary

Build a hero section for Lesego (Les), a male cinematic photographer.
The hero should feel like a movie opening — dark, emotional, and elegant.
Include:

Background video (slow-motion reel of portraits or golden-hour b-roll)

Text animation sequence (fade-in, slide-up, glow effects)

Tagline: “Cinematic Portraits. Real Emotion. Main Character Energy.”

Two buttons: “Book a Shoot” and “View Portfolio”

Smooth scroll cue animation leading into the next section

All transitions should feel like a film cut — soft, fluid, and cinematic
