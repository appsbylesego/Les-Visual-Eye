🔥 Let’s go, Les — here’s the next scene of your site: the Portfolio Section — designed to flow seamlessly from your cinematic hero.
This section is where the visitor feels like they’re stepping into your world — scrolling through visual stories instead of just images.

🎞️ Portfolio Section — “The Story Unfolds”
🎬 Transition from Hero

As the user scrolls down, the hero video slowly fades into black, then reveals your first set of photos.
A subtle parallax effect makes your images appear layer by layer — like film stills being projected.
You can add a soft whoosh sound or film reel motion for extra drama (optional).

Every frame. Every emotion. Every story told through my lens.

💡 Scroll Animation Idea

As the user scrolls:

- Photos fade in one by one with a cinematic zoom effect (slightly moving forward like a camera dolly).

- Each image has soft motion blur on entry.

- Hovering on an image causes a slow zoom-in and light flare across it.

- The page background subtly darkens behind the hovered image (for focus).

🎨 Grid Style

Use a masonry-style grid (like Pinterest but cinematic).
Each image tile has a short label overlay in white or gold text.

Example Categories:

- Cinematic Faces — Emotional close-ups with intense expression.

- Golden Hour Moments — Warm tones and natural light.

- Urban Vibes — Street portraits, energy, and motion.

- The Look Back — Over-the-shoulder and reflective shots.

- Motion Frames — Walking, movement, and cinematic blur.

Each category should feel like a film chapter — when clicked, it opens a lightbox gallery with smooth left-right transitions (like scrolling through film stills).

⚙️ Animation Flow (Claude Context)

1. Scroll Start: Hero fades into dark overlay → “The Portfolio” text fades in.

2. 0–1s after entry: Background shifts slightly (parallax camera pan).

3. 1–3s: First 3 photos fade in sequentially.

4. Hover: Slow zoom, light leak, name overlay slides up.

5. Click: Full-screen lightbox with black background + arrow navigation.

6. Scroll End: Transition fades into next section — Packages.

💬 Copywriting Text (for top of section)

Every frame I shoot tells a story — cinematic lighting, raw emotion, and atmosphere that pulls you in.

Scroll through my visual stories and see what cinematic photography feels like.

🧠 Claude Prompt Summary

Create a “Portfolio” section that transitions smoothly from the hero section of Lesego’s site.
The layout should use parallax and fade-in animations for cinematic storytelling.
Use a dark background with soft gold highlights.
Include 4–5 categories (Cinematic Faces, Golden Hour Moments, Urban Vibes, The Look Back, Motion Frames).
Each photo tile should animate on scroll and zoom slightly on hover.
The section should flow into the next scene — “Packages.”
