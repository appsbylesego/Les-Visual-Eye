1️⃣ Frontend

React (with Vite) ✅

Very fast, modern bundler

Perfect for component-based UI (Hero, Portfolio, Packages, About, Contact)

Supports animation libraries easily

Styling / UI

TailwindCSS → fast, responsive, modern design, good for cinematic gradients and glow effects

Framer Motion → for scroll-triggered animations, fade-ins, parallax, button hover effects

ShadCN / Headless UI → for tabs, dropdowns, modals (like package details or lightbox)

Optional UI/Visual Libraries

Three.js / React-Three-Fiber → only if you want 3D cinematic effects, subtle parallax depth

GSAP → for complex scroll-triggered cinematic animations

React-Lottie → for subtle animated icons or scroll effects

2️⃣ Backend / Form Handling

Since you want email-only communication:

Form submission:

Formspree / EmailJS / Netlify Forms → send form submissions to your email without a backend

Optional: Firebase Functions or a simple Node.js API if you want more control later

No phone integration needed, keeping it safe

3️⃣ Hosting / Deployment

Vercel → best for React/Vite, fast, free SSL, easy deployment

Netlify → also great, handles forms easily without backend

Both support:

Server-side redirects

Automatic image optimization

Fast global CDN

4️⃣ Animations / Cinematic Effects

Framer Motion → scroll-triggered animations, fade-ins, zoom, parallax

GSAP + ScrollTrigger → optional if you want very complex cinematic scroll animations

Tailwind + custom CSS → for hover glows, gradients, lens flare overlays

5️⃣ Optional Enhancements

Cloudinary / Imgix → optimized image hosting for fast loading and cinematic quality

Video backgrounds / Motion clips → hosted via MP4 or Lottie animations for cinematic hero and side portraits

Lazy loading → for portfolio images to maintain fast performance

My Thoughts / Recommendation

Stick with React + Vite + Tailwind + Framer Motion → simple, fast, highly customizable.

Only add GSAP / Three.js if you want extra cinematic parallax or 3D effects — otherwise it can be overkill.

Use Vercel for deployment and email integration via Formspree → safe, professional, and easy to manage.


======================
1️⃣ Responsive Layouts

TailwindCSS → built-in responsive utilities: sm:, md:, lg:, xl:

Hero Section → full-screen video on desktop, scaled and centered for mobile

Portfolio Grid → switch from masonry 3–4 columns (desktop) → 1–2 columns (mobile)

Package Cards → horizontal layout on desktop → stacked vertical cards on mobile

About Section → split-screen desktop → stacked (portrait above text) on mobile

Contact Form → full-width stacked input fields

2️⃣ Typography & Readability

Responsive font sizes: Tailwind utilities like text-lg md:text-2xl

Ensure line-height and spacing adjust for smaller screens

Avoid too-long text blocks on mobile → break into smaller paragraphs

3️⃣ Images & Media

Use responsive images: <img srcSet> or Cloudinary / Imgix for automatic sizing

Lazy-load images to improve mobile performance

Videos → optimized MP4 or WebM, use object-fit: cover for full-screen scaling on all devices

Avoid autoplay heavy videos on mobile → optionally show a static hero image fallback

4️⃣ Touch Interactions

Hover animations → fallback for touch devices: scale, pulse, or subtle animation on tap

Buttons → larger tap areas, at least 44px x 44px for mobile accessibility

Scroll-triggered animations → Framer Motion works on mobile, just test performance

5️⃣ Performance Optimization

Use Vite’s fast bundling + code splitting

Compress images/videos for mobile bandwidth

Tailwind + PurgeCSS → removes unused CSS, keeps bundle small

Optional: enable lazy loading for portfolios, background videos, and motion clips

6️⃣ Navigation & UX

Sticky or collapsible navbar for mobile

Hamburger menu with smooth toggle animation

CTA buttons prominently placed on mobile (e.g., Book Session)

✅ Summary

With React + Vite + Tailwind + Framer Motion, your site can be:

Fully responsive (desktop → tablet → mobile)

Optimized for performance (lazy load, compressed media)

Touch-friendly and easy to navigate

Cinematic on all screen sizes
