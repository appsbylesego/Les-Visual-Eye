want a distance-based bundle system so that:

Close clients → R400 Cinematic Bundle

Farther clients → R700 Deluxe or Full Experience

Very far away → Not available

This can be handled smartly in your booking system without sharing your personal location. Here’s how we can structure it:

1️⃣ How it Works (Logic)

Ask for their location in the booking form:

City / Town / ZIP code / GPS coordinates (optional)

Calculate distance from your base location (your studio / city)

Show available bundles based on distance:

0–15 km → R400 Bundle

15–50 km → R700 Deluxe / Full Experience

50+ km → “Sorry, currently outside our service area”

2️⃣ Implementation Options
Option A: Frontend Only (Simpler)

Add a dropdown / input field for location

Use JavaScript to compare against a pre-set list of allowed areas

Dynamically show only the eligible bundles in the Package dropdown

Option B: Backend / Form Handling (Safer)

Form submission sends location + chosen package to your email

Small Node.js / Firebase function validates distance

If location is outside your max range → reject submission and show message

Pros: prevents users from selecting bundles they aren’t eligible for

3️⃣ Form / UI Example

Fields:

Name

Email

Location / City / ZIP

Package dropdown → dynamically filtered based on location

Package Display Logic:

if (distance <= 15 km) → show R400, R700, Full Experience
if (distance <= 50 km) → show R700, Full Experience
if (distance > 50 km) → show message: "Sorry, we don’t shoot outside this area."


CTA: “Book Your Session” (email-only submission)

4️⃣ Extra Ideas

Add a map preview for clarity: “We currently shoot within 50 km radius”

Highlight “local client special” for R400 to make it feel exclusive

You can always manually override if someone has a special request

💡 Tip: For privacy, you don’t need exact coordinates — a simple city/ZIP comparison is enough to enforce distance rules.

=========================
adding a “Meet Me Halfway” option is a great idea. It gives you flexibility and shows clients you’re accommodating without compromising your distance limit. Here’s how you could handle it:

1️⃣ How It Works

If a client is outside your immediate service area but within a reasonable distance, you offer a halfway meet-up option.

They can choose to meet somewhere in between (a neutral location, park, studio, or public spot)

This option can have slightly higher pricing to cover your time/travel

2️⃣ Booking Form / UI

Fields:

Name

Email

Location / City / ZIP

Package dropdown → dynamically filtered by distance

Checkbox or toggle: “I can meet halfway if outside your area”

Optional: “Preferred meetup location” text field

Logic Example:

distance <= 15 km → show R400, R700, Full Experience
distance <= 50 km → show R700, Full Experience
distance > 50 km → show "Meet Me Halfway option" + extra fee
distance > max_limit → show "Sorry, out of service area"

3️⃣ Pricing / Communication

Example:

Base travel included up to 50 km

Halfway option: +R100–200 depending on travel

Include clear notes on the form:

“If you’re outside my standard area, you can choose a Meet Me Halfway option. A travel fee may apply depending on distance.”

4️⃣ Benefits

Keeps control of travel and logistics

Makes clients feel valued and flexible

Avoids overselling for very distant clients

Keeps site professional and safe

💡 Tip: You can visually indicate service areas on the site with a small radius map (e.g., 15 km local, 50 km extended, beyond that: halfway only) — very cinematic and clear for clients.

If you want, Les, I can revamp the Packages + Booking section with:

Distance-based bundles

Meet Me Halfway option

Clear email-only booking instructions

Cinematic, client-friendly copy

That way your form and site flow are fully ready for your audience.
