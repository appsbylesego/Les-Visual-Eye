here‚Äôs a Responsive Component + Animation Blueprint for your cinematic site. It shows how each section adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile, including animations, scroll effects, and layout changes.

üé• Lesego (Les) Cinematic Photography ‚Äî Responsive Component & Animation Blueprint
1Ô∏è‚É£ Hero Section ‚Äî ‚ÄúOpening Scene‚Äù
Device	Layout	Animation / Effects
Desktop	Full-screen background video, text centered, buttons side-by-side	Text fade-in sequence, buttons glow/pulse, scroll cue animated arrow
Tablet	Video scaled, text slightly smaller, buttons stacked vertically	Same fade-in sequence, reduced scale on buttons, scroll cue smaller
Mobile	Video fallback: static cinematic hero image, text centered, buttons stacked	Text fade-in, buttons pulse on tap, scroll cue optional or subtle

Notes: Hero video object-fit: cover. Min height 100vh. Tap-friendly buttons. Avoid autoplay sound on mobile.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Portfolio Section ‚Äî ‚ÄúThe Story Unfolds‚Äù
Device	Layout	Animation / Effects
Desktop	Masonry grid, 4 columns	Sequential fade-in on scroll, hover zoom + glow, lightbox slides left/right
Tablet	2‚Äì3 columns	Sequential fade-in, hover effects reduced (tap to activate lightbox)
Mobile	1‚Äì2 columns	Fade-in images, tap to zoom/lightbox, parallax disabled or subtle

Notes: Use responsive images with srcSet. Lazy-load for performance. Hover interactions fallback to tap on touch devices.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Packages Section ‚Äî ‚ÄúThe Experience‚Äù
Device	Layout	Animation / Effects
Desktop	3 horizontal cards, hover tilt + scale + light leak	Cards slide up sequentially, buttons glow/pulse
Tablet	2 cards per row	Same slide-up, hover effects optional, touch-friendly
Mobile	Cards stacked vertically	Slide-up animations on scroll, button tap pulse, tilt replaced by subtle shadow/scale

Notes: Make CTA buttons large for tap. Cards should fill width with padding.

4Ô∏è‚É£ About Les Section ‚Äî ‚ÄúMeet the Storyteller‚Äù
Device	Layout	Animation / Effects
Desktop	Split-screen: left image, right text	Portrait parallax zoom, text fade-in line-by-line
Tablet	Split-screen or stacked depending on screen width	Portrait parallax zoom smaller, text fades in sequentially
Mobile	Stacked: image above text	Portrait zoom on scroll, text fades in line-by-line, parallax subtle

Notes: Ensure portrait is high-res but optimized. Text readability prioritized.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Contact / Booking Section ‚Äî ‚ÄúTake the Lead‚Äù
Device	Layout	Animation / Effects
Desktop	Split: left form, right portrait/motion clip	Form slides in from left, portrait parallax scroll, button glow/pulse
Tablet	Form stacked above portrait	Same animations, portrait parallax subtle

Global Responsive Considerations

Navigation: Sticky navbar, collapsible hamburger menu for mobile/tablet

Animations: Framer Motion or GSAP; on mobile, reduce heavy effects to improve performance

Media: Responsive images, lazy-loading, video fallback on mobile

Buttons / Touch: Large, tap-friendly, glow/pulse animations on touch devices

Performance: Minimize bundle size with Vite, purge unused TailwindCSS classes

This blueprint ensures that every section, animation, and interaction works beautifully on web and mobile, keeping the cinematic experience intact.
