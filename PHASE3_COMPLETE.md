## 🔒 Firestore Data Structure:

### Messages Collection:

```javascript
messages/{messageId}
{
  bookingId: "booking123",       // Links message to specific booking
  senderId: "user123",           // UID of sender
  senderName: "John Doe",        // Display name of sender
  recipientId: "admin" | "user456", // UID of recipient
  text: "Looking forward to the shoot!",
  read: false,                   // Message read status
  createdAt: Timestamp
}
```

---

## 🚀 Admin Access:

### How to Set Up Admin Role:

1. **Sign in** to your account via Google
2. Go to **Firebase Console** → **Firestore Database**
3. Find the `users` collection
4. Locate **your user document** (by your email)
5. **Edit** the document and change:
   ```
   role: "client"  →  role: "admin"
   ```

7. **Refresh** the website
8. You'll now see:

## 🔒 Firestore Security Rules Update:

Add these rules to allow messaging:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users collection
    match /users/{uid} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == uid;
    }

    // Bookings collection
    match /bookings/{bookingId} {
      allow create: if request.auth != null;

      allow read: if request.auth != null && (
        resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid ||
        get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin'
      );

      allow update, delete: if request.auth != null &&
        get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';
    }

    // Messages collection (NEW!)
    match /messages/{messageId} {
      // Anyone authenticated can create messages
      allow create: if request.auth != null;

      // Users can read messages where they are sender or recipient
      // Admins can read all messages
      allow read: if request.auth != null && (
        resource.data.senderId == request.auth.uid ||
        resource.data.recipientId == request.auth.uid ||
        get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin'
      );

      // Only allow updating 'read' status
      allow update: if request.auth != null && (
        resource.data.senderId == request.auth.uid ||
        resource.data.recipientId == request.auth.uid ||
        get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin'
      );
    }
  }
}
```
