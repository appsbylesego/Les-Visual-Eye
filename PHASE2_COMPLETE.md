# 🎉 Phase 2 Complete - Booking System with Distance Calculation!

## ✅ What's Now Working:

### 1. **Distance-Based Booking System**
- Clients select their province and city from dropdown
- System automatically calculates distance from your studio
- Available packages filtered based on distance rules:
  - **0-15km**: All packages (R400, R700, R1,200)
  - **15-30km**: Deluxe & Full Experience (R700, R1,200)
  - **31-50km**: Full Experience only (R1,200)
  - **51-60km**: Full Experience with "Meet Me Halfway" option (+R150)
  - **Beyond 60km**: Out of service area

### 2. **Smart Booking Form**
- Province and city selection (30+ South African locations)
- Real-time distance calculation
- Dynamic package availability
- "Meet Me Halfway" option for 51-60km range
- Preferred date selection
- Additional notes field
- Form validation
- Success confirmation

### 3. **My Bookings Dashboard**
- Real-time booking status tracking
- View all booking details:
  - Package info (title, price, photo count)
  - Location and distance
  - Preferred date
  - Booking status (Pending, Queued, Approved, Completed)
  - Queue position (when queued)
- Status badges with color coding
- Empty state when no bookings

### 4. **Client Portal Views**
- **Dashboard**: Overview with action cards
- **My Bookings**: List of all bookings
- **New Booking**: Complete booking form
- Smooth transitions between views
- "Back" navigation

### 5. **Firestore Integration**
- Bookings saved to Firebase
- Real-time updates (booking changes reflect instantly)
- User-specific queries (clients only see their bookings)
- Proper data structure for future admin features

## 🎯 How It Works:

### For Clients:

1. **Sign in** → Go to Client Portal
2. **Click "New Booking"** card
3. **Select Province & City**
4. System calculates distance and shows available packages
5. **Choose a package** → Fill in preferred date and notes
6. **Submit** → Booking created with "Pending" status
7. **View in "My Bookings"** to track status

### Booking Statuses:

- **Pending** 🟠: Awaiting your review
- **Queued** 🔵: Approved and in queue (shows position)
- **Approved** 🟢: Confirmed and ready
- **Completed** 🟡: Session done
- **Cancelled** ⚫: Booking cancelled

---

## ⚙️ Configuration Needed:

### 1. Update Your Base Location

**File**: `src/utils/distance.ts` (line 17-21)

```typescript
export const BASE_LOCATION = {
  lat: -25.7479,  // ← REPLACE WITH YOUR ACTUAL LAT
  lng: 28.2293,   // ← REPLACE WITH YOUR ACTUAL LNG
  city: 'Pretoria'
};
```

**How to get your coordinates:**
1. Open Google Maps
2. Right-click on your location
3. Click the coordinates at the top
4. Copy and paste into the code

### 2. Adjust Distance Thresholds (Optional)

**File**: `src/utils/distance.ts` (line 24-32)

You can modify the distance bands and rules if needed.

### 3. Add More Cities (Optional)

**File**: `src/data/locations.ts`

Add more South African cities if your clients need them:

```typescript
{ name: 'Your City', lat: -XX.XXXX, lng: XX.XXXX, province: 'Province' }
```

## 🔒 Firestore Security Rules Needed:

You'll need to add these rules in Firebase Console → Firestore Database → Rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users collection
    match /users/{uid} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == uid;
    }

    // Bookings collection
    match /bookings/{bookingId} {
      // Anyone authenticated can create a booking
      allow create: if request.auth != null;

      // Users can read their own bookings
      // Admins can read all bookings
      allow read: if request.auth != null && (
        resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid ||
        get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin'
      );

      // Only admins can update/delete bookings
      allow update, delete: if request.auth != null &&
        get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == 'admin';
    }
  }
}
```

**To add these rules:**
1. Firebase Console → Firestore Database
2. Click "Rules" tab
3. Paste the rules above
4. Click "Publish"

## 🧪 Testing the System:

### Test Flow:

1. **Sign in** to portal
2. **Create a booking**:
   - Select "Gauteng" → "Pretoria CBD"
   - Should show all 3 packages
   - Pick "Cinematic Bundle"
   - Submit
3. **Check "My Bookings"**
   - Your booking should appear with "Pending" status
4. **Create another from far location**:
   - Select "Western Cape" → "Cape Town CBD"
   - Should show "Out of Service Area" message

### Test Different Distances:

- **Close (0-15km)**: Pretoria, Centurion → All packages
- **Mid (15-30km)**: Midrand → Deluxe & Full
- **Far (31-50km)**: Johannesburg → Full Experience only
- **Halfway (51-60km)**: Rustenburg → Meet Me Halfway option
- **Too Far (60km+)**: Cape Town → Out of service area

---

## 📊 Firestore Data Structure:

### Bookings Collection:

```javascript
bookings/{bookingId}
{
  userId: "user123",
  userName: "John Doe",
  userEmail: "john@example.com",
  packageId: "bundle" | "deluxe" | "full",
  location: {
    name: "Pretoria CBD",
    province: "Gauteng",
    lat: -25.7479,
    lng: 28.2293
  },
  distanceKm: 10.5,
  distanceBand: "0-15km (Local)",
  preferredDate: "2025-02-15" | null,
  meetHalfway: false,
  meetupLocation: null | "City Park",
  notes: "Looking for golden hour shots",
  status: "pending" | "queued" | "approved" | "completed" | "cancelled",
  queuePosition: 3 (optional),
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  lastUpdated: Timestamp
}
```
